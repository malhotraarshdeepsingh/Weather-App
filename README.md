# Weather-App

Welcome to my weather app repository!
This project marks my debut in API integration, and I'm thrilled to share it with you. Leveraging a seamless blend of Bootstrap for the frontend and API integration, I've crafted an intuitive weather application.  

With this app, you can effortlessly check the weather conditions for any location. Its user-friendly interface, powered by Bootstrap, ensures a smooth and engaging experience.  

Explore the world's weather patterns with ease, thanks to the API integration that fetches real-time data, providing accurate forecasts.  

Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or simply enjoy using the app!
